# IP-Address-Spoofing-with-Python
This script was written for the purpose of crafting fake IP addresses to test network security by using Scapy and Faker to send spoofed ICMP packets. 


Usage:
$ python3 ip_spoofer.py [IP Address to Ping]


The receiving computer will receive a request from you, but with a fake IP address. Perfect for evading detection.
